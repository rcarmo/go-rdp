This project is a Go-based HTML5 RDP client that also uses tinygo to compile WebAssembly modules for bitmap decompression.

When working in it, use `make` to run linting, building, testing, etc. If there is anything missing from the `Makefile` that you need, please add it there instead of running commands manually.
